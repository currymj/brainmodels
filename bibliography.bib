	abstract = {This paper describes a new {NMR} imaging modality--{MR} diffusion tensor imaging. It consists of estimating an effective diffusion tensor, Deff, within a voxel, and then displaying useful quantities derived from it. We show how the phenomenon of anisotropic diffusion of water (or metabolites) in anisotropic tissues, measured noninvasively by these {NMR} methods, is exploited to determine fiber tract orientation and mean particle displacements. Once Deff is estimated from a series of {NMR} pulsed-gradient, spin-echo experiments, a tissue's three orthotropic axes can be determined. They coincide with the eigenvectors of Deff, while the effective diffusivities along these orthotropic directions are the eigenvalues of Deff. Diffusion ellipsoids, constructed in each voxel from Deff, depict both these orthotropic axes and the mean diffusion distances in these directions. Moreover, the three scalar invariants of Deff, which are independent of the tissue's orientation in the laboratory frame of reference, reveal useful information about molecular mobility reflective of local microstructure and anatomy. Inherently tensors (like Deff) describing transport processes in anisotropic media contain new information within a macroscopic voxel that scalars (such as the apparent diffusivity, proton density, T1, and T2) do not.},

	abstract = {Modern {MRI} image processing methods have yielded quantitative, morphometric, functional, and structural assessments of the human brain. These analyses typically exploit carefully optimized protocols for specific imaging targets. Algorithm investigators have several excellent public data resources to use to test, develop, and optimize their methods. Recently, there has been an increasing focus on combining {MRI} protocols in multi-parametric studies. Notably, these have included innovative approaches for fusing connectivity inferences with functional and/or anatomical characterizations. Yet, validation of the reproducibility of these interesting and novel methods has been severely hampered by the limited availability of appropriate multi-parametric data. We present an imaging protocol optimized to include state-of-the-art assessment of brain function, structure, micro-architecture, and quantitative parameters within a clinically feasible 60-min protocol on a 3-T {MRI} scanner. We present scan-rescan reproducibility of these imaging contrasts based on 21 healthy volunteers (11 M/10 F, 22-61 years old). The cortical gray matter, cortical white matter, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid, thalamus, putamen, caudate, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, and brainstem were identified with mean volume-wise reproducibility of 3.5\%. We tabulate the mean intensity, variability, and reproducibility of each contrast in a region of interest approach, which is essential for prospective study planning and retrospective power analysis considerations. Anatomy was highly consistent on structural acquisition ({\textasciitilde}1-5\% variability), while variation on diffusion and several other quantitative scans was higher ({\textasciitilde}{\textless}10\%). Some sequences are particularly variable in specific structures ({ASL} exhibited variation of 28\% in the cerebral white matter) or in thin structures (quantitative T2 varied by up to 73\% in the caudate) due, in large part, to variability in automated {ROI} placement. The richness of the joint distribution of intensities across imaging methods can be best assessed within the context of a particular analysis approach as opposed to a summary table. As such, all imaging data and analysis routines have been made publicly and freely available. This effort provides the neuroimaging community with a resource for optimization of algorithms that exploit the diversity of modern {MRI} modalities. Additionally, it establishes a baseline for continuing development and optimization of multi-parametric imaging protocols.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DWI}) tractography is widely used to map structural connections of the human brain in vivo and has been adopted by large-scale initiatives such as the human connectome project. Our results indicate that, even with high-quality data, {DWI} tractography alone is unlikely to provide an anatomically accurate map of the brain connectome. It is crucial to complement tractography results with a combination of histological or neurophysiological methods to map structural connectivity accurately. Our findings, however, do not diminish the importance of diffusion {MRI} as a noninvasive tool that offers important quantitative measures related to brain tissue microstructure and white matter architecture., Tractography based on diffusion-weighted {MRI} ({DWI}) is widely used for mapping the structural connections of the human brain. Its accuracy is known to be limited by technical factors affecting in vivo data acquisition, such as noise, artifacts, and data undersampling resulting from scan time constraints. It generally is assumed that improvements in data quality and implementation of sophisticated tractography methods will lead to increasingly accurate maps of human anatomical connections. However, assessing the anatomical accuracy of {DWI} tractography is difficult because of the lack of independent knowledge of the true anatomical connections in humans. Here we investigate the future prospects of {DWI}-based connectional imaging by applying advanced tractography methods to an ex vivo {DWI} dataset of the macaque brain. The results of different tractography methods were compared with maps of known axonal projections from previous tracer studies in the macaque. Despite the exceptional quality of the {DWI} data, none of the methods demonstrated high anatomical accuracy. The methods that showed the highest sensitivity showed the lowest specificity, and vice versa. Additionally, anatomical accuracy was highly dependent upon parameters of the tractography algorithm, with different optimal values for mapping different pathways. These results suggest that there is an inherent limitation in determining long-range anatomical projections based on voxel-averaged estimates of local fiber orientation obtained from {DWI} data that is unlikely to be overcome by improvements in data acquisition and analysis alone.},
